# Example

**Q:** Summarize this transcript on how to build AI prompts

**A:**

**Bottom Line Up Front**

This video teaches viewers how to move from basic conversational prompting (like using ChatGPT templates) to advanced single-shot prompt engineering that can replace hundreds of lines of code and create scalable AI systems worth thousands of dollars.

**Main Premise: The Midwit Trap**

- Left side (Low IQ): People who use ChatGPT casually
- Middle (Midwit): Prompt engineers who rely on templates without deep understanding
- Right side (Genius): Those who use research-backed prompting techniques

**Key Quote:**

> "Your ability to prompt them and provide instruction of these models directly impacts your ability to get value out of them."

**Why Most People Are Bad at Prompt Engineering**

- Conversational Prompting: Casual, multi-step human-in-the-loop approach
- Single-Shot Prompting: Critical for automation, requires high precision
- High Stakes: Single-shot skills lead to scalable, valuable AI systems
- Karpathy Quote: "The hottest new programming language is English"
- Core Thesis: "A well-written prompt can replace hundreds of lines of code"

**The Perfect Prompt Formula (ROLE-TASK-SPECIFICS-CONTEXT-EXAMPLES-NOTES)**

Each component is backed by academic research:

- **ROLE:** Assign expert identity (+15–25% performance)
- **TASK:** Use step-by-step instructions (up to 90% gain for complex problems)
- **SPECIFICS:** Add emotional reinforcement (115% boost on complex tasks)
- **CONTEXT:** Describe business/environment relevance
- **EXAMPLES:** Few-shot examples improve accuracy from 10% to 60%
- **NOTES:** Reminders at beginning or end avoid "Lost in the Middle" performance drops

**Advanced Techniques**

- Use markdown formatting for clarity
- Choose appropriate model/temperature settings for cost and reliability
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps for cheaper models
- Positive phrasing and persona-based prompting improve results

**Real-World Use Case**

- Email classification system built from scratch
- Before: One-sentence prompt
- After: Full scientific prompt → 300%+ accuracy gain

**Final Comparison**

- Midwit: Template-only, expensive models, poor reliability
- Genius: Research-based, optimized prompts, fast + affordable outputs

**Key Takeaways**

- Prompting is foundational to all AI use cases
- A scientific approach yields better performance and business value
- Avoiding this skill = less money, less value, lower impact

**Final Quote:**

> "If you don't take the time to actually soak in this information... you are not going to make any money in AI because everything depends on it."

# Notes

- Do not generalize; be specific and retain nuance.
- Use bullet points or short paragraphs for readability.
- Do not include opinions, only what was actually said in the video.
- Your summary should reflect the true structure, tone, and depth of the original content.
- If the transcript is fragmented or unclear, do your best to infer the intended message based on surrounding context.
